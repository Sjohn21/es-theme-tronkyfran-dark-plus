			<text>The PC Engine, known as the PTurboGrafx-16 in North America, is a fourth-generation home video game console. It was the first console marketed in the fourth generation of game consoles, commonly known as the 16-bit era, though the console has an 8-bit central processing unit (CPU). In Japan, the system was launched as a competitor to the Famicom, but the delayed United States release meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later the Super NES. The console has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit graphics processing unit (GPU) chipset. The GPUs are capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512.  Games were released on HuCard cartridges and later the CD-ROM optical format with the TurboGrafx-CD add-on. The "16" in its North American name and the marketing of the console as a 16-bit platform despite having an 8-bit CPU was criticized by some as deceptive.</text>
