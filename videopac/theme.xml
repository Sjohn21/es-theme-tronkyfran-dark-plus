			<text>The Videopac, known in North America as the Magnavox OdysseyÂ², in Brazil as the Philips Odyssey and also by many other names, is a video game console released in 1978. In the early 1970s, Magnavox was an innovator in the home video game industry. They succeeded in bringing the first home video game system to market, the Odyssey, which was quickly followed by a number of later models, each with a few technological improvements (Magnavox Odyssey Series). In 1978, Magnavox, now a subsidiary of North American Philips, released the Videopac, its new second-generation video game console. In 2009, the video game website IGN named the Videopac the 21st greatest video game console, out of its list of 25.</text>
