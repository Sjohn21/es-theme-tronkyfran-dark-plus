			<text>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System is a 16-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in North America, Europe, Australasia (Oceania), and South America between 1990 and 1993. In Japan and Southeast Asia, the system is called the Super Famicom or SFC for short. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other consoles at the time. The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era despite its relatively late start and the fierce competition it faced in North America and Europe from Sega's Genesis console. The SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era and it continues to be popular among fans, collectors, retro gamers, and emulation enthusiasts, some of whom are still making homebrew ROM images.</text>
